                            <p>The goal of this lab was to test the Artemis board with a number of examples to confirm its functionality. This involved testing the LED on the board, the serial output, the temperature sensor, and the microphone.</p>

                            <p>To test the LED on the Artemis Board, the "Blink it Up" example was used. This code turned the LED on for an specified time, then turned the LED off for a specified time. In the example video below, the LED was on for 2 seconds, then off for 1 second.</p>

                            <p>In the second example, the objective was to test the serial monitor output. In this example, the Arduino sent a counting test to the serial monitor. It then allowed the user to type an input into the serial monitor, and the Artemis Board would read this and output the input into the serial monitor. This can be seen in the photo below. </p>

                            <p>The third test involved using the temperature sensor. The temperature was sent to the serial monitor in 10^-3 degrees Celsius. To validicize the sensor, I covered the Atermis board with my hand, and the temperature increased slightly from 32.9 Celsius to 33.1 Celsius.</p>

                            <p>This test was done to determine the musical note "A." When the microphone identified an "A," which has a frequency of about 440Hz, the LED would turn on. Otherwise, the LED would remain off. The code here had a range of frequencies +-10 away from 440Hz, as the note can vary slightly. Here, the frequency was found to be 446Hz.</p>

                            <p>The objective of this lab was to establish a bluetooth connection between the Artemis board and a computer. This lab involved connecting Python code to the Artemis using Arduino programming. This will then be used to send data via Bluetooth to use in future labs.</p>

                            <p>The bluetooth software used in this course was not compatible with Windows 11. Becuase of this, the setup involved loading Debian using WSL, Windows Subsystem for Linux. This was loaded onto the Windows 11 laptop, and Python using Jupyter Notebook was loaded through the WSL. Using this system, the Artemis board was able to connect to the Python code.</p>

                            <p>Once Debian was loaded onto the laptop, the next step was to connect the Artemis Board to the Python code. The first step in this process was to change the MAC address of the Artemis from the default in the code to the one used in the lab. By uploading the given ble_arduino.ino code file to the Artemis, the MAC address reads c0:07:1c:96:23:44, shown in the figure below.</p>
                            <span class="d-none d-lg-block"><img src="assets/img/Lab2MacAddress.jpg" alt="..." width="500" height="200" /></span>
                            <p>The MAC address was also changed in the Python code in the connection.yaml file shown below. This allows the Python code to read the device via bluetooth and connect to the Artemis. The second step needed to connect the device was to use a unique UUID address. Many of the Artemis boards in the course share the same MAC address, meaning the Python code might connect to different boards. Because of this, a UUID was needed to create a unique connection to the Artmeis board. This was generated in Python and then put in the "ble_service" line in connection.yaml, as well as the "BLE_UUID_TEST_SERVICE" in the Arduino code.</p>

                            <p>In order to test the connection between the Artemis board on the computer, multiple commands were made. The first was the ECHO command. This command sent a character string to the Artemis from the Python code, which then sent the phrase back to the Python code. This command was added to the Arduino code in ble_arduino.ide. Here, echo was added to the list of command types:</p>

                            <p>The code for the ECHO command is shown below:</p>

                            <p>In Python, the command is sent and received using these lines of code:</p>

                            <p>The next command involved receiving the current time from the Artemis board. This meant using the millis() function in the Arduino package, then converting this value to a double, and sending it as a string to Python. The Arduino code is shown here:</p>

The message array will be useful for future use of the function as we will be able to receive multiple string arrays without calling it manually. This code is shown below:</p>

The Arduino code was similar to the previous command, except it used a while loop until the code either hit 5 seconds, or the maximum amount of data points was extracted. Additionally, the data was stored in an array of strings on the Artemis, and once gathered, the strings were then sent in a for loop to the Python code. This enables to increase the speed of the data taken because you remove the step of sending the data while collecting the data.</p>

Through testing multiple byte replies in intervals of 10, it can be seen that the data rate increases with the amount of bytes sent through the graph below. This trend shows that the larger replies help reduce overhead. However, if the size is too large, the data rate will break the trend and decrease, as seen comparing byte replies with greater than 100 bytes.</p>

                            <p>For the robot, we are using two identical Time-of-Flight sensors, specifically VL53L1X API. These sensors share an I2C address of 0x52. Because the ToF flight sensors have the same I2C address, we will need to use an I/O pin to connect to one of the ToF sensors and shut it off. After this, we will need to change the I2C address of the one that is currently on. Then we will need to turn the other ToF sensor on. This will allow us to read both sensors as the addresses will be different.</p>
                            <p>The placement of the two sensors are very important in optimizing the robot's movement. There are 4 possible placements for the ToF sensors that will be considered. One must be in the front, as the car will need to know what it is driving towards. However, the second one can either be placed in the front, one of the sides, or in the back. Placing it in the front will give a more accurate reading of what is in front of the robot because we will be given more readings at one time. However, it will take longer to understand its position, as it will need to rotate to understand its surroundings. Placing it in the back is also a possibility. However, from looking at past years’ robots, it seemed challenging to position the ToF sensor in the back, as much of the hardware was in the way. Because of these reasons, the second ToF sensor will be placed on one of the sides. This will allow the robot to understand its surroundings quicker than with both sensors in the front.</p>

Though this is not the 0x52 address shown in the datasheet, the last bit is taken off because it is used as a read/write bit, meaning it is not read in the address. Because of this, the address is either 0x52 or 0x29 because they share the same seven bits except for the one that is not read.</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Testing the ToF Sensor</h3>
                            <p>In order to confirm the reliability of the sensor, we need to test its measurement data. This was done by comparing four different measurements. The ToF sensor has three modes, short, medium, and long. The three modes depend on the usage of the robot. The short distance mode has more accuracy. Because of this, a slowly moving robot will benefit because it can react within 1.3m of distance. The long distance mode is beneficial for fast robots. Though there is more sensor noise, the sensor can detect 4m worth of distance, and the fast-moving robot will be able to react in time if it senses something. The medium distance mode is in between both in terms of range and distance. Initially, I believe that the robot should start with the short distance mode. This will minimize the noise of the sensor, and will help initially as we begin to work with the robot. However, through testing the robot in future labs, the 1.3m distance may not be far enough for the robot to react. This will mean that increasing the mode may be necessary.</p>
                            <p>The short distance mode was tested by taking sensor data at 0.3m, 0.6m, 0.9m, and 1.2m. Ten data points from the sensor were taken at each point and are shown in the graph below. The sensor was very close to the actual measurements, however slightly overshot the actual measurement by 0.01m for each measurement.</p>

                            <p>Described in the prelab, the two sensors need to have different I2C addresses in order to be able to gather data from both. To do this, one of the sensors was given 0 power from pin 8, and then the sensor that still was power was changed to have an address of 0x20. The other sensor was then turned on, and both were connected:</p>

                            <p>For future labs, it is important for the robot to gather data as quickly as possible. To test this, the sensor readings were compared to time, shown in the video below. The time between measurements taken was about 40ms. This is the minimum time between data points, meaning that the limiting factor was the time that the Artemis takes between reading and sending the data. </p>

                            <p>Infrared distance sensors use infrared radiation to detect objects. There are two main types of infrared sensors: active and passive. Active infrared sensors work by emitting infrared radiation, hitting an object and then bouncing back that radiation to the device. This is useful for detecting the range of an object from the device. Passive infrared sensors work by receiving the infrared radiation emitted by objects around the device. This is useful for detecting abnormalities in its proximity. For example, it is beneficial for security purposes to detect a person who shouldn’t be there or any movements in the room. However, this does not determine the distance from an object. An active infrared sensor is better for that, however, it takes longer, as it needs to both send and receive the signal. Because our robot needs to measure distances, the Time-of-Flight sensor is an active infrared sensor.</p>
                            <p>To test if the Time-of-Flight sensor is sensitive to color and textures, three colors and two textures were tested. White, red, and blue surfaces with similar textures were tested and had the same distance of 250mm from the sensor. This showed that color did not really affect the sensor much. Additionally, smooth plastic and rough cotton was tested, but this also did not affect the sensor, both having about an average distance of 250mm.</p>

                            <p>In order to test the IMU, the basic example under the IMU's library manager was used. This code is shown running below. Here, AD0_VAL is the last bit of the I2CC address. By default, it is 1. We will leave it at 1 to maintain the correct address.</p>

                            <p>When plotting the output with Serial Plotter on Arduino, there seems to be little noise when the IMU is not moving. This is beneficial to us because this can allow us to reset the robot if its sensor readings are unreliable while moving at any point. In the second plot, the IMU was moving, showing that noise increases while the IMU moves.</p>

                            <p>The accelerometer on the IMU gathers the acceleration in micro G's. In order to calculate the angle on the x and y axis, roll and pitch respectively, we need to use the inverse tangent. The equations for roll (phi) and pitch (theta) are shown below:</p>

                            <p>Using these equations, the pitch and roll were found at each time step and plotted using Serial Plot, seen below. When rotating either pitch or roll to 90 degrees, the other becomes very noisy at 90 degrees. For example, the first rotation to -90 degrees was pitch, and once it hit 90, the roll angle became very noisy, when it should have stayed close to 0.</p>

                            <p>Because of the noise in the sensor, a frequency spectrum analysis was done to determine if a low pass filter was needed to decrease the noise in the sensor reading.<p>

                            <p>Based on the plots above, it was determined that a low pass filter was not needed, as there was no high amplitude outliers at large frequencies where we will operate the robot. Additionally, from looking at the data sheet, the IMU has a low pass filter as its default, meaning an additional filter was not needed to improve the noise.</p>

                            <p>In order to decrease the noise from the accelerometer data, the gyroscope reading needed to be taken. From the graphs below, the gyroscope data drifts as time increases, with the first plot being with a 20s delay, and the second being with a 100s delay. Though the data has little noise, this drifting would cause major errors with the robot, giving it the wrong angles. Because of this, the gyroscope and accelerometer needed to be combined to create an accurate sensor with little noise. Additionally, by comparing the graphs, the longer the delay the larger the amount the gyroscope drifts. This measn that we want to try and minimize the time between data points while running our robot.</p>

                            <p>The complimentary filter, with the code shown below, was developed to solve this issue. This filter uses a weight function to prevent noise due to the accelerometer and drifting due to the gyroscope. This weight is defined by alpha, and is determined through testing.</p>

                            <p>The value for alpha was determined to be 0.1, with the plot of the angles shown below. This filter significantly minimized the noise of the measurements, and kept accurate measurements.</p>

                            <p>By removing all delays and Serial.print statements, and by storing time, accelerometer data, and gyroscope data, the new values are sampled at an average of 3ms. This is very fast, and will unlikely be used as this will give us a large amount data in a small amount of time, which will in turn take up storage on the Artemis and prevent us from understanding what the robot does for a long period of time. The data was stored in 7 string arrays, and then sent to Jupyter one timestep at a time. This is shown below:</p>
                            <span class="d-none d-lg-block"><img src="assets/img/Lab4_SampleData_IMU.jpg" alt="..." width="500" height="450" /></span>

                            <p>To test both the Time-of-Flight and IMU sensors together, both were connected to the Artemis using the breakout board. The data was then collected in separate string arrays, and then sent to Jupyter one line at a time. This is seen by the output from Jupyter:</p>

                            <p>Given the one 850mAh battery and one 650mAh battery, the decision was to power the Artemis with the 650mAh battery, and power the batteries with the 850mAh battery. This will be done for two reasons. The first is that the motors will require more energy to run than the Artemis. This means that using the 850mAh battery will last the motors longer than the 650mAh battery will. The second reason is that the 850mAh battery will make the robot faster than the 650mAh at its maximum, as it will be able to send more power to the motors. Because of this, the 650mAh battery was converted to fit the Artemis, as seen in the image below:</p>

                        <p>The robot can move in very quick motions and maneuver around objects very easily. While testing the robot, it was notice that the speed was unable to change. In the video below, the robot spun in a circle. However, it was unable to slow down, maintaing its fast pace. In future labs, we will work with PWM in order to be able to slow the robot and control the velocity of its motion.</p>
